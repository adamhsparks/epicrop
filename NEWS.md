# epicrop 0.0.0.9017

* Update README R output.

* Polish map output in the mapping vignette.

* Polish names for figure in multiple locations figure.

* Remove references and functionality called from _epifitter_; AUDPC is calculated internally now.

* Add new vignette to demonstrate mapping AUDPC values using lat/lon from model output.

# epicrop 0.0.0.9015

## Minor changes

* Add area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) values to model output.

  - `predict_bacterial_blight()` > `predict_bb()`
  - `predict_brown_spot()` > `predict_bs()`
  - `predict_leaf_blast()` > `predict_lb()`

## Bug fixes

* Fixes bug when that caused a failure fetching CHIRPS weather data.

# epicrop 0.0.0.9014

## Minor changes

* Check user inputs for `H0` and `I0` to ensure that they are >= 0.

* 100% complete test coverage.

* The final `data.frame` created from vectors of state values in `SEIR()` is simplified into one step, creating a named `data.table` rather than create a `data.table` and then naming cols.

# epicrop 0.0.0.9013

## Bug fixes

* Fixes a bug introduced into SEIR() with the last round of bug fixes.
The calculations for latent and infectious sites were still calculating for the next, not current, day in the `for()` loop.

* Corrects values in the example for `SEIR()` to run the model for brown spot.

## Minor changes

* Updates input values for `Rc` curves in each of the EPIRICE models such that the values used to compute the curve are all supplied, none are computed before the interpolation is performed.
This leads to longer, but clearer lines of code.

* All of the help files now reference NASA POWER and CHIRPS both as sources of possible weather data for use in the model.

# epicrop 0.0.0.9012

## Bug fixes

* Fixes bug in `SEIR()` where `Rc` value was calculated incorrectly that was introduced with commit https://github.com/r-forge/cropsim/commit/ba093b252deb222f1ffe54b3a7f0d14b6192f18c#diff-17fd120d02f173b87db7e09b563e2057b95391bef823eee29cbff30cb3d80287. See Lines 124:126 that were changed to Lines 118:120 where
```r 
Rc[day+1] <- baseRc * AFGen(ageRc, day) * AFGen(tmpRc, wthsub$tavg[day+1]) * RHCoef[day+1]
```
should have been
```r
Rc[day+1] <- baseRc * AFGen(ageRc, day+1) * AFGen(tmpRc, wthsub$tavg[day+1]) * RHCoef[day+1]
```
to calculate the basic infection rate, `Rc`, for `day + 1`. Commit: [248df5512b5897e950dd58a0a8b3fd57922add47](https://github.com/adamhsparks/epicrop/commit/248df5512b5897e950dd58a0a8b3fd57922add47).

* Fixes typos in `RcA` values for `predict_bacterial_blight()` and `predict_sheath_blight()`.
  * In `predict_bacterial_blight()` the eighth entry was improperly encoded as 0.42, it has been corrected to 0.41, commit [8b2c36b61d4f949385dcac4c03ff435b8400e335](https://github.com/adamhsparks/epicrop/commit/8b2c36b61d4f949385dcac4c03ff435b8400e335).
  * In `predict_sheath_blight()` the seventh entry was improperly encoded as 0.83, it has been corrected to 0.84, Commit: [69b89ce24dd41c16d4627225c028355f76a64b80](https://github.com/adamhsparks/epicrop/commit/69b89ce24dd41c16d4627225c028355f76a64b80).

## Major changes

* Implements a new function to calculate the correction values for crop age, `RcA`, and temperature, `RcT`, using `approx()` in a custom function that is faster than the `select_mod_value()` function.

* Implements new functionality for `get_wth()` to optionally get data from the CHIRPS/CHIRTS APIs in addition to the default NASA POWER API.

* Uses one-indexed `for()` loop, in place of the zero-indexed `for()` loop found in _cropsim_.

# epicrop 0.0.0.9011

## Minor changes

* Fix title in vignette entry.

* Remove `lazyData` field from DESCRIPTION.

* Remove redundant `maintainer` field from DESCRIPTION.

* Remove dates (date when knit) from vignettes.

* Fix/clean up note on parallel processing in "Multiples" vignette.

* Better, more consistent documentation.

* Update `get_wth()` to work with the new (unreleased) version of _nasapower_ that works with the new version of the POWER API.

# epicrop 0.0.0.9010-1

## Minor changes

* Fixes issue in vignettes with duplicate titles and plot theming.

# epicrop 0.0.0.9010

## Major changes

* **BREAKING CHANGE** `intensity` column, in `SEIR()` is now a proportion, _i.e._ values range between 0 - 1.
If you wish to have the same values as previously reported, `df$intensity*100` will give you these values.

* **BREAKING CHANGE** Removes column, `severity`, in `SEIR()` output.

* Adds a new vignette illustrating how to run multiple simulations and use parallel processing to reduce run time for these simulations.

# epicrop 0.0.0.9009

## Major changes

* **BREAKING CHANGE** Add a new column to `SEIR()` output, `severity`, not to be confused with the previous column called `severity` (now called `intensity`), which represents the cumulative proportion of diseased sites on day "x" expressed as, $\frac{diseased\ sites}{total\ sites}\times100$.

## Minor changes

* More improvements to function documentation, include `#' @family predict functions` in each of the `predict` functions rather than only using `'# @seealso`.

# epicrop 0.0.0.9008

## Major changes

* * **BREAKING CHANGE** The `severity` output column from `SEIR()` has been renamed as `intensity` to follow the nomenclature of Savary _et al._ 2012.
This column represents the proportion of actively diseased sites on day "x" expressed as, $\frac{(diseased\ sites-removed\ sites)}{(total\ sites-removed\ sites)}\times100$.

# epicrop 0.0.0.9007

## Minor changes

* Only include Lat/Lon values if the `wth` object provides them.

* Better documentation about the Lat/Lon values in the output of `SEIR()`

* Parameters for `predict_bacterial_blight()` are used as basis for all of the other `predict_*()` family of functions.

* Add DOI to CITATION and DESCRIPTION files.

* Add Lifecycle and DOI badges to README files.

# epicrop 0.0.0.9006

## Minor changes

* Optimise `SEIR()` internal functionality.

* Minor improvements to documentation.

* Polish NEWS.md.

# epicrop 0.0.0.9005

## Minor changes

* Only import _data.table_ functions as necessary, don't import whole package.

## Bug fixes

* Convert `wth` (weather input object) to a `data.table` type object internally if it is not already one.
Prior, if the object was not a `data.table`, `SEIR()` would fail with a message that the dates did not align.
This should fix that issue and any `data.frame` type object including a `tibble` can be provided now.
Thanks to Jean Fabrice Adanve for helping me find this bug.

# epicrop 0.0.0.9004

## Bug fixes

* Fixes bug where the relative humidity checks in `SEIR()` only checked if the daily RH value was equal to (`==`) not equal to or greater than (`>=`) the set parameter for `rhlim` (default is 90%).

* Example for `SEIR()` in _roxygen_ section now works properly when executed by the user.

## Major changes

* Any default parameter values are moved from `SEIR()` to the `predict_()` functions themselves, so any calls directly to `SEIR()` must specify all parameters.

* Deleted `inst/alt_versions/tungrov2.R` file.

* Deleted `inst/workflows/spatsim.R` file. 

## Minor changes

* Edit documentation for better clarity

* Better commenting in code for self and others' reference

* `SEIR()` is simplified and further optimised
  * In some cases in the `for()` loop, the value of `day + 1` was repeatedly calculated and assigned to a new object. This has been corrected with a single object, `d1` being created at the beginning of each loop instance.
  * In some cases where RH, TEMP or RAIN are repeatedly checked against, vectors of these three values are created outside the loop to save time when checking or extracting values.
  * Redundant code and other unused objects are cleaned up and removed.
  
* Standardise library loading calls to use standard evaluation in documentation.

* Standardise italics to use "_" rather than "*".

* Use `ggplot2::theme_classic()` for example figures in README and {epicrop} vignette.

# epicrop 0.0.0.9003

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
