\title{Predict rice leaf severity}
\usage{
predict_leaf_blast(wth, emergence, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{wth}{Weather data with a daily time-step, normally NASA-POWER from
\code{\link{get_wth}}, but any \code{\link[base]{data.frame}} object that has
the following properly named columns in them will work.
\tabular{rl}{
\strong{YYYYMMDD}:\tab Date as Year Month Day (ISO8601).\cr
\strong{DOY}:\tab  Consecutive day of year, commonly called "Julian date".\cr
\strong{TM}:\tab Mean daily temperature (°C).\cr
\strong{TN}:\tab Minimum daily temperature (°C).\cr
\strong{TX}:\tab Maximum daily temperature (°C).\cr
\strong{TDEW}:\tab Mean daily dew point temperature (°C).\cr
\strong{RH}:\tab Mean daily relative humidity (\%).\cr
\strong{RAIN}:\tab Mean daily rainfall (mm).\cr
}}

\item{emergence}{Expected date of crop emergence}

\item{...}{Additional arguments, see \code{\link{SEIR}}}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[data.table]{data.table}} of disease severity and
infection sites. See \code{\link{SEIR}} for a full description of the
column values.
}
\description{
A dynamic mechanistic simulation of leaf blast disease of rice, causal agent
\emph{Magnaporthe oryzae}.
The model is driven by daily weather data. Adapted from \pkg{cropsim} package
version 0.2.0-5 by Adam H. Sparks - USQ CCH.
Original model development: Serge Savary & Rene Pangga (IRRI).
Original \R implementation by Robert J. Hijmans, Rene Pangga, & Jorrel
Aunario (IRRI).
