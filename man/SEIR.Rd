}
}
\description{
This function is originally used by specific disease models in
\sQuote{EPIRICE} to model disease intensity of several rice diseases.  Given
proper values it can be used with other pathosystems as well.
}
\section{\emph{a} - Aggregation}{
When \emph{a} is set to \code{1} the assumption is that that there is no disease
aggregation with new infections occurring at random among the healthy sites.
When \emph{a} is greater than \code{1} there is aggregation in the disease occurrence,
the pathogen is unable to access the entire population of healthy sites,
which results in disease aggregation. Refer to Savary \emph{et al.} (2012) for
greater detail.
}

\section{\emph{LAT}/\emph{LON}}{
If the \code{wth} object provides \emph{LAT} and \emph{LON} columns, these will be included
in the output for mapping purposes. Both values must be present. These
columns are provided by default when using \code{\link[=get_wth]{get_wth()}}.
