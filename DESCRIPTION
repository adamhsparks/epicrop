Description: Generic simulation modelling of crop diseases using a Susceptible-
    Exposed-Infectious-Removed ('SEIR') model. This type of model was first
    described in botanical epidemiology by Zadoks (1971)
    <doi:10.1094/Phyto-61-600> and implemented in the 'EPIRICE' model by Savary
    et al. (2012) <doi:10.1016/j.cropro.2011.11.009> detailing the model's
    development, use and results from modeling global unmanaged
    epidemics of rice diseases for five major rice diseases, bacterial blight,
    brown spot, leaf blast, sheath blight and tungro. A second model, 'EPIWHEAT'
    was published by Savary et al. (2015) <doi:10.1007/s10658-015-0650-7> that
    added a lesion expansion parameter and modelled potential disease epidemics
    of leaf (brown) rust and Septoria tritici blotch. Specific functions are
    provided to simulate all of these diseases with a generic 'SEIR' model
    function that is suitable for parameterising for use with other pathosystems
    as demonstrated in Savary et al. 2012 and 2015.
