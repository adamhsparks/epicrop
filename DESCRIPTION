Description: Generic simulation modelling of crop diseases using a Susceptible-
    Exposed-Infectious-Removed ('SEIR') model.  This type of model was first
    described in botanical epidemiology by Zadoks (1971)
    <doi:10.1094/Phyto-61-600> and implemented in the 'EPIRICE' model by Savary
    et al.Â (2012) <doi:10.1016/j.cropro.2011.11.009> detailing the model's
    development, use and results from modeling global unmanaged
    epidemics of rice diseases for five major rice diseases, bacterial blight,
    brown spot, leaf blast, sheath blight and tungro.  Specific functions are
    provided to simulate all of these diseases with a generic 'SEIR' model
    function that is suitable for parameterising for use with other pathosystems
    as demonstrated in Savary et al. 2012.
