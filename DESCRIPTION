Description: A fork of the 'cropsim' R package by Hijmans et al., this package
    intends to make the `EPIRICE` model easier to use. The original manuscript
    by Savary et al. (2012) detailing the model use and results modeling global
    epidemics of rice diseases was published in Crop Protection
    (<DOI: 10.1016/j.cropro.2011.11.009>) detailing global disease risk of five
    major rice diseases, bacterial blight, brown spot, leaf blast, sheath blight
    and tungro. `epirice` provides functions to simulate all of these diseases
    and also provides a generic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR)
    model that is suitable for use in other pathosystems as well provided the
    proper inputs.
