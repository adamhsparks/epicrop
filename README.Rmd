A fork of the R [cropsim package](https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=335) designed to make using the EPIRICE model for rice diseases easier to use.
This version provides easy to use functions to fetch weather data from NASA POWER,
via the [*nasapower*](https://cran.r-project.org/package=nasapower) package and predict disease severity of five rice diseases using a generic SEIR model (Zadoks 1971) function, `SEIR()`.

The original manuscript, Savary et al. (2012), which details the model and results of its use to model global epidemics of rice diseases was published in Crop Protection detailing global unmanaged disease risk of bacterial blight, brown spot, leaf blast, sheath blight and tungro, which are included in this package.

# Quick start

You can easily simulate any of the five diseases for rice grown anywhere in the world from 1983 to near current given internal functionality.
Alternatively, you can supply your own weather data for any time period as long as it fits the model's requirements.

`epirice` is not yet on CRAN. You can install it this way.

``` r
if (!require("remotes"))
  install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("adamshsparks/epirice"
)
```

## Get weather data

First you need to provide weather data for the model.
*epirice* provides the `get_wth()` function to do this.
Using it you can fetch weather data for any place in the world from 1983 to near present by providing the longitude and latitude and dates.

```{r power}
library(epirice)

# Fetch weather for year 2000 wet season at the IRRI Zeigler Experiment Station
 wth <- get_wth(
   lonlat = c(121.25562, 14.6774),
   dates = c("2000-06-30", "2000-12-31")
 )

wth
```

## Modelling bacterial blight disease severity

Once you have the weather data, run the model for any of the five rice diseases by providing the emergence or crop establishment date for transplanted rice.

```{r predict_bb}
 bb <- predict_bacterial_blight(wth, emergence = "2000-07-01")

bb
```

Once you have the results you can visualise them.

```{r plot_severity}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = bb,
       aes(x = dates,
           y = severity)) +
  labs(y = "Severity",
       x = "Date") +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Bacterial blight disease progress over time",
       caption = "Weather data acknowledgement:\nThese data were obtained from the NASA Langley Research Center POWER Project\nfunded through the NASA Earth Science Directorate Applied Science Program.") +
  theme_light()
```
