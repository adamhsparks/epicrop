A fork of [_cropsim_](https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=335) (Hijmans _et al._ 2009) designed to make using the EPIRICE model (Savary _et al._ 2012) for rice diseases easier to use.
This version provides easy to use functions to fetch weather data from NASA POWER, via the [_nasapower_](https://cran.r-project.org/package=nasapower) package (Sparks 2018, Sparks 2020) and predict disease intensity of five rice diseases using a generic SEIR model (Zadoks 1971) function, `SEIR()`.

The original EPIRICE manuscript, Savary _et al._ (2012), which details the model and results of its use to model global epidemics of rice diseases, was published in _Crop Protection_ detailing global unmanaged disease risk of bacterial blight, brown spot, leaf blast, sheath blight and rice tungro, which are included in this package.

# Quick start

You can easily simulate any of the five diseases for rice grown anywhere in the world for years from 1983 to near current using `get_wth()` to fetch data from the [NASA POWER web API](https://power.larc.nasa.gov).
Alternatively, you can supply your own weather data for any time period as long as it fits the model’s requirements.

{epicrop} is not yet on CRAN. You can install it this way.

```{r eval=FALSE}
if (!require("remotes"))
  install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("adamhsparks/epicrop",
                        build_vignettes = TRUE
)
```

## Get weather data

First you need to provide weather data for the model; {epicrop} provides the `get_wth()` function to do this.
Using it you can fetch weather data for any place in the world from 1983 to near present by providing the and latitude and dates or length of rice growing season as shown below.

```{r weather}
library("epicrop")

# Fetch weather for year 2000 wet season for a 120 day rice variety at the IRRI
# Zeigler Experiment Station
wth <- get_wth(
  lonlat = c(121.25562, 14.6774),
  dates = "2000-07-01",
  duration = 120
)

wth
```

## Modelling bacterial blight disease intensity

Once you have the weather data, run the model for any of the five rice diseases by providing the emergence or crop establishment date for transplanted rice.

```{r example}
bb <- predict_bacterial_blight(wth, emergence = "2000-07-01")

bb
```

Lastly, you can visualise the result of the model run.

```{r plot, fig.cap="Bacterial blight disease progress over time. Results for wet season year 2000 at IRRI Zeigler Experiment Station shown. Weather data used to run the model were obtained from the NASA Langley Research Center POWER Project funded through the NASA Earth Science Directorate Applied Science Program.",}
library("ggplot2")

ggplot(data = bb,
       aes(x = dates,
           y = intensity)) +
  labs(y = "Intensity",
       x = "Date") +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic()
```
